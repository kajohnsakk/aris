        by our solicitors) and loss of any kind arising from any actual or alleged claim by a third party that any of Your Data
        infringes the rights of that third party (including Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights) or that Your Data
        is objectionable, incorrect or misleading.</p>
        
        <p><strong>17.Your Registration Information</strong></p>

        <p>17.1. Subject to the Privacy Policy of ARIS, ARIS will generally use Your registration information as specified on the
        Registration Form for general display access by Buyers, Merchants or other Platform Users, for internal administrative
        purposes and to contact You from time to time in connection with Your use of the Platform or to inform You of the latest
        features. ARIS may provide aggregated or generalised User information to third parties provided always that Your
        specific information is never disclosed (unless authorised by You or as may be required to comply with the lawful
        directions of any authority with competent jurisdiction).</p>
        <p>17.2. Subject to the Privacy Policy of ARIS, the content of any communication feedback to this Platform including
        suggestions and comments will be treated as non-confidential and shall become the property of ARIS. ARIS shall be free
        to use such communication for any purpose unless otherwise You have withdrawn your consent or asked to be anonymous.</p>
        <p>17.3 If the processing of Personal Data is governed by the PDPA, the additional terms in the Data Processing Addendum
        also form part of these Terms.</p>
        <p>17.4 You acknowledge and agree that in collecting, holding and processing Personal Data through the Service or Platform,
        we are acting as your agent for the purposes of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Thailand), and as the data
        processor for the purposes of the PDPA. If the PDPA applies, the additional terms in the Data Processing Addendum also
        form part of these Terms. You must obtain all necessary consents from the relevant individual to enable us to collect,
        use, hold and process Personal Data in accordance with these Terms and, if applicable, the Data Processing Addendum.</p>
        
        <p><strong>18.Delay or Force Majeure</strong></p>

        <p>ARIS will not be liable for any failure or delay arising from events beyond ARIS's control, including but not limited
        to, acts of God, insurrection or civil disorder, war or military operations, national or local emergency, acts or
        omissions of government, telecommunication or public utility disruption or failure, industrial disputes of any kind
        (whether or not involving employees), failure of equipment, bugs, viruses, accidents, material shortages, explosion,
        subsidence, inclement weather, acts or omissions of persons or bodies for whom the party is not responsible or any other
        causes outside it's control.</p>
        
        <p><strong>19.Disputes</strong></p>

        <p>ARIS will not involve itself in any private dispute between Users whether or not arising out of a Transaction. Any valid
        dispute raised by You directly in connection with the Platform will be first addressed by ARIS customer service
        representatives and/or later by ARIS management in good faith. Failing any resolution with ARIS management, then such
        dispute or difference shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Thailand in accordance with SIAC or
        Commercenet rules for the time being in force which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The
        arbitration shall be conducted in English. This shall not preclude ARIS from being entitled to obtain immediate
        injunctive and other equitable relief from any convenient court without bond and without necessity of showing actual
        monetary damage upon a breach of Clause 13, 14 or 15 above.</p>

        <p><strong>20.Assignment</strong></p>

        <p>These Terms will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of You and ARIS's respective successors and permitted assigns.
        Your rights and obligations under these Terms may not be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part, without
        the prior written consent of ARIS. ARIS may assign its right to receive any payment from You under these Terms to a
        majority owned subsidiary of ARIS or such other entity or third party approved by ARIS by written notice to You without
        the need for consent.</p>

        <p><strong>21.Notices</strong></p>

        <p>Any notice, request, waiver, consent or approval shall be in writing in the English language and shall be deemed to have
        been duly given or made when it is delivered by hand, by registered mail, facsimile or by electronic mail (as the case
        may be) to Your respective registered notification address provided by You to ARIS. Except where otherwise provided
        under these Terms, notices shall be deemed duly served and given immediately if by hand; two (2) days after postage, if
        by registered mail; upon transmission, if by confirmed facsimile; and upon transmission with no returned receipt failure
        message, if by electronic mail.</p>

        <p><strong>22.General</strong></p>

        <p>22.1. You and ARIS are independent contractors. No agency, partnership, franchise or formal business organisation of any
        kind is created by these Terms and neither party will have the right to bind the other.</p>
        <p>22.2. No waiver of any breach of these Terms shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other or of any subsequent breach.
        The failure of ARIS to enforce at any time any of the Terms shall in no way be interpreted as a waiver of such
        provision.</p>
        <p>22.3. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, these Terms shall remain
        otherwise in full force apart from such provision which shall be deemed deleted.</p>
        <p>22.4. These Terms will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the Kingdom of Thailand excluding the
        application of its conflicts of law rules.</p>
        <p>22.5. Unless we otherwise agree in writing, these Terms (incorporating the Data Processing Addendum and Privacy Policy)
        constitute the entire agreement between You and ARIS with respect to the use of the Platform and Services. These Terms
        supersede all prior and contemporaneous representations or understandings. Unless expressly agreed by ARIS, these Terms
        shall always prevail over any inconsistent terms or conditions embodied within any purchase order, invoice or other
        documentation issued to ARIS by a Buyer, Merchant or other third party under or in connection with the use of the
        Platform.</p>
