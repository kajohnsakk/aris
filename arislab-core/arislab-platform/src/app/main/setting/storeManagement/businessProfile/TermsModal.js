        Our lawful basis for processing (as that term is defined in the PDPA)

        <br />
        Generally, we collect personal data from you where we have your consent,
        where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
        you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to
        entering into a contract, or where processing is necessary for the
        purposes of our legitimate interests (except where such interests are
        overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms). <br />
        <br />
        Where we process personal data based on your consent, you may withdraw
        your consent at any time. Despite this, we may process your personal
        data where such processing is necessary for compliance with applicable
        laws.
        <br />
        <br />

        you or similarly significantly affects you, except where such automated
        decision-making is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a
        contract with you, is authorised by applicable laws or is based on your

        decision-making.
        <br />
        right to data portability - you may obtain your personal data from us
        that you have consented to give us or that is necessary to perform a

        portability to another data controller. Where technically feasible, and

        We use cookies on our website and as part of our related services, and
        receive information collected through cookies. This cookie policy
        explains how we use cookies and how you can opt out of cookies. <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        We use the term cookies in this cookie policy to mean cookies or similar

        <br />
        <br />
        WHAT ARE COOKIES
        <br />
        <br />
        Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are
        downloaded to your browsing device, e.g. a computer or smartphone, when
        you visit a website. Cookies can be recognised by the website that
        downloaded them, or by other websites that use the same cookies. This
        helps a website know if the browsing device has visited that or other
        websites before. <br />
        <br />
        Cookies can be used to collect information relating to your use of a
        website or your device, let you navigate between pages effectively, help
        to remember your preferences and generally improve your browsing
        experience. Cookies can also help ensure advertising you see online is
        more relevant to you and your interests.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cookies can be session or persistent cookies. Session cookies are
        temporary and only stay on your browser until you stop browsing.
        Persistent cookies stay on your device until they expire or are deleted.
        <br />
        <br />
        The cookies used on our website may be first party cookies (i.e. set by
        us) or third-party cookies (i.e. cookies set on our website by a person
        other than us). The third-party companies that place cookies on our
        website will have their own privacy policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        WHAT Types of cookies DO we use
        <br />
        <br />
        The types of cookies used by us, and most websites, can generally be
        categorised as follows.
        <br />
        <br />
        Strictly necessary cookies
        <br />
        <br />
        These cookies are essential for the full functionality of our website
        and related services. They enable you to navigate around our website and
        services and use their features e.g. accessing secure areas and enabling
        services that you have asked to receive. If you opt out of these
        cookies, you may not be able to access all the functions of our website
        and some services that you have asked to receive. <br />
        <br />
        These cookies do not track where else you have been on the internet and
        do not remember your preferences beyond your current visit. These
        cookies are generally first party session cookies which will expire when
        you close your browsing session. These cookies do not collect
        information that could be used for marketing purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Functionality cookies
        <br />
        <br />
        These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make and provide
        enhanced, more personal features. e.g. these cookies allow us to
        remember the settings you have applied to the website (such as font
        size, preferences or colours), identify whether you are a returning
        website visitor and present you with a personalised version of the
        website, or eliminate the need for you to re-enter your login details.
        The information these cookies collect is generally anonymous and they do
        not track your browsing activity on other websites. These cookies may be
        first or third party, session or persistent cookies.

        Performance cookies
        <br />

        from any page. This information helps us improve the way our website and
        related services work and helps us manage the performance and design of
        the website and services. These cookies do not gather information that
        identifies you. All of the information these cookies collect is

        <br />
        <br />
        Targeting cookies are used to present advertising that is relevant to
        you and your interests. These cookies collect information about your
        browsing habits e.g. the pages you have visited and the links you have
        followed across the internet. They may also be used to limit the number
        of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of
        advertising campaigns. These cookies will usually be persistent but
        time-limited and may be placed on our website by third party service
        providers or advertising partners with our permission. <br />
        <br />
        We use targeting cookies to present interest-based advertising on our
        website and for retargeting. This is a form of interest-based
        advertising that enables our advertising partners to build a profile of
        your interests and show you advertising based on your browsing activity
        across the internet, including to allow us to advertise to people who
        previously visited our website.
        <br />

        website. Google Analytics collects information related to your device,
        browser, IP address, network location, and website activities to measure
        and report statistics about your interactions on our website. We use
        this information to help us manage the performance and design of our
        website and to improve our website.

        cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers
        to prevent them from being placed. However, if you do this, you may have

        support@arislab.ai. <br />
        <br />
        Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean
        you will no longer be served advertising. You will continue to receive
        generic ads.

          waiver of any other or of any subsequent breach. The failure of ARIS
          to enforce at any time any of the Terms shall in no way be interpreted
          as a waiver of such provision.

          or illegal for any reason, these Terms shall remain otherwise in full

          and Services. These Terms supersede all prior and contemporaneous

          conditions embodied within any purchase order, invoice or other
          documentation issued to ARIS by a Buyer, Merchant or other third party
          under or in connection with the use of the Platform.

        <p>4. OUR PERSONNEL</p>
        <p>1. We will:</p>
        <p>
          1. take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any of our
          Personnel engaged in the Processing of Personal Data;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. ensure that access to Personal Data is limited to our Personnel who
          require that access as strictly necessary for the purposes of
          exercising our rights and performing our obligations under the Terms;
        </p>
        <p>
          3. ensure that our Personnel engaged in Processing Personal Data are
          subject to confidentiality undertakings or professional or statutory
          obligations of confidentiality; and
        </p>
        <p>
          4. ensure that our Personnel engaged in Processing Personal Data are
          informed of the confidential nature of the Personal Data and receive
          appropriate training on their responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>2. SUBPROCESSESORS</p>
        <p>
          1. You acknowledge and agree that we may engage third party
          Sub-Processors in connection with the provision of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We have entered into (and will, for any new Sub-Processor, enter
          into) written agreements with each Sub-Processor containing data
          protection obligations which offer at least the same level of
          protection for Personal Data as set out in this Addendum and that meet
          the requirements of Article 28(3) of the PDPA, as applicable to the
          nature of the services provided by that Sub-Processor.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. You may request copies of our written agreements with
          Sub-Processors (which may be redacted to remove confidential
          information not relevant to this Addendum).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. A list of current Sub-Processors for the Services as at 20 Jan 2020
          is set out in Schedule 2. We may update the list of Sub-Processors
          from time to time and, subject to clause 6.5, we will give at least 30
          days’ written notice of any new Sub-Processor.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We may engage Sub-Processors as needed to serve as an Emergency
          Replacement to maintain and support the Services. Emergency
          Replacement means a sudden replacement of a Sub-Processor where a
          change is outside our reasonable control. In this case, we will inform
          you of the replacement Sub-Processor as soon as reasonably
          practicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. If you object to any new Sub-Processor, you may, despite anything
          to the contrary in the Terms, terminate these Terms and your right to
          access and use the Service without penalty on written notice, provided
          (in the case of a new Sub-Processor notified under clause 6.4) your
          notice of termination is received by us before the effective date of
          our notice under clause 6.4 or (in the case of a new Sub-Processor
          notified under clause 6.5) your notice of termination is received by
          us within 30 days of our notice of the new Sub-Processor. If you do
          not terminate these Terms and your right to access and use the Service
          in accordance with this clause, you are deemed to have agreed to the
          new Sub-Processor.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          7. We are liable for the acts and omissions of our Sub-Processors to
          the same extent we would be liable if performing the services of each
          Sub-Processor directly under the terms of this Addendum, except as
          otherwise set out in this Addendum.
        </p>
        <p>3. SECURITY</p>

          We will maintain technical and organisational measures to protect the
          confidentiality, integrity and security of Personal Data (including
          protection against unauthorised or unlawful Processing and against
          accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage,
          unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data), and to
          manage data security incidents affecting Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p>1. SECURITY BREACH MANAGEMENT</p>
        <p>
          1. We will comply with all applicable laws requiring notification to
          you of any accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
          unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Personal Data Processed by us
          or our Sub-Processors of which we become aware (Breach Incident).
        </p>
        <p>
          2. We will make reasonable efforts to identify the cause of that
          Breach Incident, notify you within a timely manner to allow you to
          meet your obligations to report a Breach Incident, and take steps we
          consider necessary and reasonable to remediate the cause of the Breach
          Incident, to the extent remediation is within our reasonable control.
        </p>
        <p>2. AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE</p>
        <p>
          Upon your written request, we will submit to your audits and
          inspections, and provide you all information necessary, to demonstrate

          under Applicable Data Protection Laws (including our respective
          obligations under Article 28 of the PDPA).

          Service, to the extent you do not otherwise have access to the
          relevant information.
        </p>
        <p>1. RETURN AND DELETION OF PERSONAL DATA</p>
        <p>
          1. Subject to clauses 11.2 and 11.3, following termination of the
          Terms we will delete all Personal Data within a reasonable period from
          termination of the Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Subject to clause 11.3, you may submit a written request to us
          within 10 working days of the termination of the Terms requiring us,

        </p>
        <p>
          1. return a complete copy of all Personal Data by secure file transfer
          in a common format; and

          Sub-Processor.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We, or each Sub-Processor, may retain Personal Data to the extent
          that it is required by applicable laws, provided that we ensure the
          confidentiality of all such Personal Data and ensure that such Data is
          only processed as necessary for the purposes required under applicable
          laws requiring its Processing and for no other purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If we cannot delete all Personal Data due to technical reasons, we
          will inform you as soon as reasonably practicable and will take
          reasonably necessary steps to:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. come as close as possible to a complete and permanent deletion of
          the Personal Data;
        </p>
        <p>2. fully and effectively anonymise the remaining data; and</p>
        <p>
          3. make the remaining Personal Data which is not deleted or
          effectively anonymised unavailable for future Processing.
        </p>
        <p>5. CHANGES IN DATA PROTECTION LAWS</p>
        <p>
          1. We may on at least 30 days' written notice to you from time to
          time, make any variations to this Addendum (including to the Standard
          Contractual Clauses), which we consider (acting reasonable) are
          required as a result of any change in, or decision of a competent
          authority under, Applicable Data Protection Law, to allow transfers
          and Processing of Personal Data to continue without breach of
          Applicable Data Protection Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. If you object to any variation under clause 12.1, you may, despite
          anything to the contrary in the Terms, terminate these Terms and your
          right to access and use the Service without penalty on written notice,
          provided your notice of termination is received by us before the
          effective date of our notice. If you do not terminate these Terms and
          your right to access and use the Service in accordance with this
          clause, you are deemed to have agreed to the variation.{" "}

          limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

          data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with
          the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and,
          where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the
          Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not
          violate the relevant provisions of that State;

        <p>
          b that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal

          of the technical and organisational security measures specified in
          Appendix 2 to this contract;
        </p>
        <p>
          d that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data
          protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect
          personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental
          loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular
          where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network,
          and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these

          the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or
          terminate the contract;
        </p>
        <p>
          b that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to
          it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data

          of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial
          adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the
          Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as
          soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to

        <p>
          i any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a
          law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a
          prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a
          law enforcement investigation,
        </p>
        <p>ii any accidental or unauthorised access, and</p>
        <p>

          Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it
          may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix
          2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security
          measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a
          copy from the data exporter;
        </p>
        <p>
          h that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the
          data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;
        </p>
        <p>
          i that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out
          in accordance with Clause 11;
        </p>
        <p>
          j to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes
          under the Clauses to the data exporter.
        </p>
        <p>Clause 6: Liability</p>
        <p>
          1 The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as
          a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or
          in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive
          compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in
          accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of
          a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their
          obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data
          exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has
          become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may
          issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data
          exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal
          obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law,
          in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such
          entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its
          obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data
          exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2,
          arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their
          obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the
          data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or
          ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor
          agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data
          subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the
          Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless
          any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the
          data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in
          which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such
          entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own
          processing operations under the Clauses.
        </p>
        <p>Clause 7: Mediation and jurisdiction</p>
        <p>
          1 The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it
          third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages
          under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the
          data subject:
        </p>
        <p>
          a to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or,
          where applicable, by the supervisory authority;
        </p>
        <p>
          b to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the
          data exporter is established.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not
          prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in
          accordance with other provisions of national or international law.
        </p>
        <p>Clause 8: Cooperation with supervisory authorities</p>
        <p>
          1 The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the
          supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required
          under the applicable data protection law.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to
          conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which
          has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would
          apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data
          protection law.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the
          existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor
          preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any
          subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data
          exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5b.
        </p>
        <p>Clause 9: Governing Law</p>
        <p>
          The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which
          the data exporter is established.
        </p>
        <p>Clause 10: Variation of the contract</p>
        <p></p>The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This
        does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related
        issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.
        <p>Clause 11: Subprocessing</p>
        <p>
          1 The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing
          operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses
          without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data
          importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the
          consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written
          agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on
          the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the
          Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection
          obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall
          remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the
          subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 The prior written contract between the data importer and the
          subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause
          as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able
          to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of
          Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they
          have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have
          become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal
          obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by
          operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall
          be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing
          of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the
          law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
        </p>
        <p>
          4 The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements
          concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant
          to Clause 5j, which shall be updated at least once a year. The list
          shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clause 12: Obligation after the termination of personal data
          processing services
        </p>
        <p>
          1 The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data
          processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at
          the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data
          transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall
          destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it
          has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer
          prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal
          data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it
          will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred
          and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          2 The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of
          the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit
          its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred
          to in paragraph 1.
